    3TierVPC_creation in AWS
1- In my AWS account I will click VPC service and create a new VPC called 3Tier-vpc and give 10.99.0.0/16 as CIDR.
2- I create 6 Subnets:  a- DMZ1public with AZ: eu-central-1a with CIDR: 10.99.1.0/24
                        b- AppLayer1private with AZ: eu-central-1a with CIDR: 10.99.11.0/24
                        c- DBLayer1private with AZ: eu-central-1a with CIDR:10.99.21.0/24
                        d- DMZ2public with AZ: eu-central-1b with CIDR: 10.99.2.0/24
                        e- AppLayer2private with AZ: eu-central-1b with CIDR: 10.99.12.0/24
                        f- DBLAyer2private with AZ: eu-central-1b with CIDR: 10.99.22.0/24
3- I create Internet Gateway: 3-tier-iwg and attach it to 3Tier-vpc.
4- We create a NAT Gateway: give a name 3-tier-ngw and set it in DMZ2public and allocate Elastic IP(static) address.
5- We create a Public Route Table:Public-RT :   - Edit routes --> Add Route Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 - Target: IGW  (because it is public
                                                - Subnet Associations: Explicit subnet associations: Select DMZ1public and DMZ2public subnets.
6- We create a Private Route Table: Private-RT: - Edit routes --> Add Route Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 - Target: NAT Gateway (because it is private)
                                                - Subnet Associations: Explicit subnet associations: Select subnets DBLayer1private, DBLayer12rivate,AppLayer1private, AppLayer2private.
7- We create NACL:  - DMZNACL with :    - Subnet Associations: DMZ1public and DMZ2public subnets
